        <p><em>You've got more important things to do than spend hours on a website.</em> That's why we designed a system built to be as easy as possible for churches like yours:</p>

            <h3>A site tomorrow. <span>(Powerful starting points.)</span></h3>
            <p>Our sites aren't just templates - they are powerful starting points with boilerplates for everything that a real church needs on a website. Stuff like a special page with info for visitors, a page about your pastor, a page with your beliefs, pages for your ministries and much more. These pages are already there and they look great - all you need to do is change the details.  Everything should just work out of the box.  Because who has time to set up a website?</p>

            <h3>So easy the pastor could do it. <span>(Easy enough he shouldn't have to.)</span></h3>
            <p>We've spent decades building websites and we've tried just about every system out there.  Most of them are confusing at best and downright scary at worst.  <strong>We set out to make a system so easy and obvious, that any volunteer can figure it out.</strong>  Testing it, we heard things like <em>"this is so much easier than anything I've used before"</em> and <em>"that's pretty obvious."</em> We think youâ€™ll agree.</p>

            <p>If you can't figure out how to do something - there are videos explaining just about everything right on the home page of the dashboard.  There are even videos explaining things like making sermon slides and recording sermon audio.</p>
