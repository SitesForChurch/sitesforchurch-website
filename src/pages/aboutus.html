    <div class="aboutUs__ourMission">
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p class="missionStatement">The mission of Sites for Church is to revolutionize the way churches get websites by offering an affordable solution that is built for churches and is as easy to use as possible.</p>
          <div class="content">
          <p>This mission didn’t come out of nowhere.  It came out of years of trying making church websites every way church websites are made.  We’ve made church websites on everything from Wordpress to Wix.  If there is a popular CMS, we’ve probably used it.</p>
          <h3>We think the whole process is broken:</h3>
          <h4>It doesn't work for churches</h4>
          <p><strong>Church websites are too hard to use</strong>.  That’s because Wordpress and other popular content management systems weren’t designed for churches.  When you use one of these as the engine for your church website, you are getting something that either  hobbled together or lacking in the features a church website needs.</p>
          <p><strong>Web designers are too hard to find</strong>. Churches are having to either find a designer “in house”  (good luck with that) or find one on the open market who is willing to work for what they can pay.</p>
          <h4>It doesn't work for web designers</h4>
          <p>The amount of time that goes into creating a great website is far more than most people realize.  There is a reason why established companies sell web design and development at such high prices.  When web designers make a church website for a few hundred dollars - they aren’t making as much money as you think they are and are probably using your church as a stepping stone for something more lucrative.</p>
          <h3>We can do better:</h3>
          <p>Sites for church was built from the ground up for churches.  We want you to have one of the best websites money can buy with all of the features you really need at a price that you can afford.</p>
          <p><strong>Our watchword is “easy.”</strong>  We’ve rewritten some of our features over and over and then over again because we thought we could make it easier for you.  We’ve had years to think about what goes into a great church website and we’ve made a lot of those decisions for you so you can get a site off the ground quickly.  We’ve eliminated some things because they don’t really help you and confuse the process.</p>
          <h3>This is our dream.</h3>
          <p>We’ve put an unbelievable amount of work into this.  Late nights and early mornings for months.  Ryan has spent a huge sum of money (from a small church pastor’s salary) and even sold his beloved computer to pay costs.  (Kind of like O.Henry's “Gift of the Magi” we think.)  He’s put other things he does (like his podcast and blogging) on hold so that this can be launched.  Alex has worked many, many weeks on this with no pay. <strong>This is something we believe in.</strong></p>
